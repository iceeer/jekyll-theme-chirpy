<p>1. Get the RC29 update from Google ( Download ) (Link is from Google Android Website)</p>
<p>2. Rename it the downloaded file from signed-kila-ota-115247-prereq.TC4-RC19+RC28.zip to update.zip, and place it in the root of your Micro SD card.</p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t forget to unplug your handset from Computer USB before proceeding for next step)</p>
<p>3. Turn off your G1, then turn it back on by holding the Home+End keys until you see an icon popup after the T-Mobile G1 logo.</p>
<p>4. From the icon screen, open the keyboard and hit Alt+L. This will display the log saying what is happening (although you can skip this step).</p>
<p>5. Now press Alt+S to begin the update. Remember, the update needs to be in the root of the Micro SD card and needs to be named update.zip.</p>
<p>6. Once it finishes, just follow the onscreen instructions and press Home+Back to finish.</p>
<p>7. The G1 will reboot a few times to flash different parts of the firmware.</p>
